## React / Redux Todo App

This is a very basic to-do app built to practice the ins and outs of data flow through a React / Redux app. For the time being, it is frontend only (there is no database on the backend that saves anything, so your todos will be lost upon refreshing!).

### TODOS
1. separate completed todos from uncompleted in TodoList (restructure data flow)
2. add list directory with & write out its functions
3. css
4. launch on gh-pages
